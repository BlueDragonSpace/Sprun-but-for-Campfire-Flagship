Turn-based, with multiple characters to control, an action queue system, and scaling.
Currently working on as a part of Hack Club's Campfire Flagship. (was previously entered into Hack Club's Milkyway)
Still in development (of course haha)

In the background, I'm trying to add in both 2D and 3D turn systems so that the main focus of the game becomes switching between dimensions to gain a tactical advantage... which is difficult to implement.
Still! 

In update to what I did on Milkyway, players now have intents, there's like 5 different enemy wave types, there's a debuff system, and a lot more work has been done on the 2D + 3D stuff.


Inspired by some of my favorite games!!! Slay the Spire, Mario + Rabbids, Balatro...
