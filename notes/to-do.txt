0.9: 
	Adding in pathfinding myself, since I need a little more control over pathfinding than Godot has
		Pass in array of all blocks to ThreeDRoot
		Finish pathfind function, link it to a node
			(what I'm currently on) make sure the path works I guess...
		Decide when to use the path_find function, and display it

1 (Connections):
	Connecting:
		Move characters to be outside of one_d_root (for all dimensions)
		
		Pathfinding: change algorithm for current direction:
			
			Create a new node that inherits from 3DPathfind, replace it's algorithm like you would a virtual func
				
			
			y-Axis is free,
			z-Axis is free, (and so on)
			x-Axis is free 
			Manhattan Distance for a grid based system:
				GDextension??? Might need to reask on Discord...
			
			
		Make the Grid-Based System...
		
		Attacks:
			Hitboxes
			Env. Blocking
			Line of Sight
			Ranged vs Melee attacks
			different targeting system
			rat spawning position
		New things:
			Environment,
			Movement Distance,
			Position shifting (from/to 1D, 2D from / to 3D is already covered)
			Beep-O Camera (Rabbids)
			Default Camera is set to be centered around a specific point, rather than a player
			2D and 3D grid
			Pathfinding (ooohhhh 3D pathfinding!!) (plus Manhattan Distance rather than Euclidian)
			"Move" Tab (how is jumping implemented)
			Sight lines and area of range for attacks (ranged vs melee)
		
		Transitioning: find position on 2D screen of a 3D character (local)
		Move camera script to not be apart of just one player (but the average position of each of them)
	
	haha sry nevermind lol
	
1.5 (BUGGS THAT ARE REALLY BAD AND GAME BREAKING):
	
	Strange rounding error, difference between shown stat bar damage and actual inflicted damage
	(need a specific case, forgot where to find one and too annoyed to bother)
	For now, it's me not paying attension to damage
	
1.6 (yeah these are bugs):
	
	Intent shows random target sometimes, but still directs actual action correctly
	
1.75 (not Connecting or bug, ver importan):
	
		Enemy: Have attacks be structured as Actions (like the class_name), maybe add sprun for charge attacks?
			Makes it so that Enemies can be reused as Charas down the line
	
2 (more mechanics):
	BACK BUTTON!!!!!!
3:
	Stone / Stun DeBuff (wow Mario + Rabbids)
	Sprun Movement Shifting depending on size (too far when small, too close when big)
	Go backward in players choosing actions with Back Button
	MegaLazer VFX! (Screenshake, line connecting player and enemy, enemy color changing)
	Litle dialogue things (but even more, like character-to-character interaction, and in the middle of battle...)
	Cat Battle! (don't actually hit the cat, or bad stuff happens)
	Turn Limit til next wave (prevent hold onto one enemy to increase Sprun stats)
	Create Custom Theme (buttons, sliders, the whole shebang)
	Differentiate between similar enemies and rats
	(Kitty, the Sun Robot thing) Gaining new attacks in new form
		Resizing Actions Tabs (think about when I played my own game on mobile) - Only changed by font_size, or perhaps add code..?
	Resize Entire Screen (any idea how truly useful this thing is on my weird -ahhh TV resolution settings???)
3.5?:
	All characters get a certain attack if there is a certain character in scene
	DFD and ATK action (at same time)
	Settings
	Credits:
		My personal touch (not some boring - ahh rolling text)
	
	Auto-count / add green text for when sprun is met (Draven playtest, the two separate corners of the screen where you have the sprun on left, and the total cost on the right)
4: 
	Death saves? (Deltarune, DnD, revival at all?)
	Kitty's 6 Lives (the 7th I don't talk about) [wait was it 9 actually]
	Hide unnecessary tabs (rat cannot defend)
	Every time an enemy dies, the TurnOrderPoint is off on which turn it really is
	
	art and music lol
	https://lonebot.itch.io/make-it-juicy
	
	Shovel's Pixel Perfect screen resolution thing (1920 x 1080)
	
	And create content lol 
		Actions
		Characters
		Enemies
		Progression(?) / Scaling
	
	Tutorial (make it good gosh darn it):
		Turn Queue!!!!!!!! (top to bottom)
		Taking away sprun vs Sprun needed to use
		What character's turn it is
5:
	Distributing...:
		Steam, Itch, so on
	Outreaching:
		Shovel: Showcase Saturday on Discord (find the emails of content creators and so on) 
	Hi_Pirates.txt
6 (almost definitely never gonna happen):
	Finish the round when final enemy dies
	Different kinds of sprun (red for ATK, blue for DFD, and so on)

Quirks:
	Balance the funny and serious (makes both more meaningful)
	2...3...4! (Tangled Up)
	Looking up Camera Angle (size up)
	Kitty needs 9 slots for their 9 lives! I did that on accident
	
	Putting an enemy inside of the player section makes the game freak out because it doesn't have set sprun slots
		However, they can still defend perfectly fine! Most stuff still works hahaha

Turn sections:
	Player Input
	Middle:
		Defense,
		Quick Actions,
		The Rest (by the timeline)
	End

Refactoring
	Animation tracks don't worry about unresolvable tracks (the NPC's animate node has a track for Enemy intent, but Player doesn't have intent and doesn't need the track)
	Make HP changing set by a tween (instead of process)
	Set that one .set() method that isn't already in ready() for some reason
	Open slot for an Action resource on the ActionButton (for use in default player actions)


Tips for players:
	Hey you can rearrange the tabs on the Action Bar (thanks Godot!)
	Beating the final enemy of a wave immediately ends the wave; you can't do actions in the turn past ending the enemy
	Prep rounds will always be at least two, because I am too lazy to add an "s" to the end
	Aggro!

Bugs:
	On the animation to the first player (after a round), last player's actions show up (but aren't clickable, thankfully)
	After Bunnell playtested, immediate next turn was an error where all enemies' last child (an audio node) was deleted, and I have no idea why that happened

Noot noot
Holy carp the game works on mobile by accident!!!!
